\ Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where an object receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. It is like giving your code a toolbox instead of making it build its own tools.

// Fill text in the 'why' section
#why
\ *Decouples components* â€“  making it way easier to swap parts without breaking everything.\ 
*Improves testability* - you can inject fake dependencies (mocks or stubs) when testing.

\ #code[```rust
struct WalletService {
  provider: BlockchainProvider, // Without DI
}
impl WalletService {
  fn new() -> Self {
    WalletService { 
      provider: BlockchainProvider::connect() // Hard-Coded dependency
    } 
  }
}
```]
Testing `WalletService` is difficult - you would need a real blockchain in your test....

\ #code[```rust
struct WalletServiceDI<'a> {
  provider: &'a dyn BlockchainProviderTrait, // With DI
}
impl<'a> WalletServiceDI<'a> {
  fn new(provider: &'a dyn BlockchainProviderTrait) -> Self {
    WalletServiceDI { provider } // The provider is passed in
  }
}
```]
Now you can simply use a mock blockchain and only test the behavior of `WalletService`.
\ #tip[
  It can also be optional - give the user the ability to provide the dependencies, but allow them to pass `None` to get the default dependency.
