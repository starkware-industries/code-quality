#what
\ Although not ideal, sometimes we want to use hard-coded values in tests â€” these are called *snapshot tests*. Itâ€™s helpful when certain outputs are expected to rarely change, like the gas cost of a fixed transaction.\
#why
\ When hard-coded tests break, the correct values are often already known â€” the computer just printed them! So why should we fix them manually?\
#how
\ All rise for the *expect-test* crate ðŸŽ‰  â€” from now on, hard-coded values fix themselves with this magic command: ```rust UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test```.
\ Instead of:
#bad_code(```rust assert_eq!(computed_value, 7)```)
\ Just do:
#good_code[```rust
expect!["7"].assert_debug_eq(computed_value);
```]
\ *Oh, youâ€™ve got multiple test cases? No worries!*
#code[```rust
fn my_gas_test(#[values(2, 3)] gas_price: u8) {
    let result = execute_tx(gas_price).gas_price;
    if gas_price == 2 {
        expect!["18"].assert_debug_eq(result);
    } else {
        expect!["27"].assert_debug_eq(result);
    }
}
```]
\ *Wait, the expected output is in a file ? No problem!*
#code[```rust
expect_file!["path_to_file.txt"].assert_debug_eq(computed_value);
```]

#call_for_action([\ Remember that time you were copy-pasting expected values into a test,
  while quietly wondering why you spent 4 years studying for this?\
  *Do your teammates a favorâ€”go fix this code now!*])
